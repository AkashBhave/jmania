# jmania
A 4-key rhythm game written in pure Java.

## Simfiles
This game reads slightly modified simfiles ending with the .csm file extension. To add simfiles to this implementation, you should have only one difficulty at a time and should remove all comments for *#NOTES*: (such that the arrows start right after it). Many metadata elements are ignored as well, such as *STOPS*, *BGCHANGES*, and *FGCHANGES* (meaning you can remove them).
